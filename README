Code written is my own except the Eigen library and main.cpp, which was originally given
as a demo of the OpenGL API and modified to use the MultObjParser class.

Note: Uses OpenGL libraries. The following commands should install
the necessary libraries for Linux:

sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install freeglut3  
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev  
sudo apt-get install libglew1.5  
sudo apt-get install libglew1.5-dev  
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa  
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev  
sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev


To build: run make.
To run: ./opengl_renderer scene_bunny1.txt 800 800

Any text file in the data/ directory can be rendered using
this program.

make test creates a regression test program which
reads in a given scene, prints some test output and also 
tests some of the Quatern operations (quaternions were used
for representing rotation matrices).

To run: ./test scene_cube1.txt
